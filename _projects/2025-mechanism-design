For our statics class, we were asked to design a mechanism that could lift the maximum weight possible. We were constrained to a design space of 50 cm tall by 150cm wide, and were given one bar, 3 pins, and 1 actuator to design this mechanism.


So far we have only done a rough sketch and slight calculations, leading me to create this drawing  /assets/images/statics-portfolio.jpg
