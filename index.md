## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile_pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}


My name is Leslie, I am a sophomore studying Biomedical Engineering with an Education Minor at Cornell University. I am very interested in community engagement, education, and advancing eye health. I have experience working with an optometrist and shadowing an ophthalmologist, and hope to contribute to the innovation of eye-care technologies, including advancing contact lenses. I also love synthetic biology, and I worked on a project developing a salmonella detecting self-regenerating yeast solution. I want to change world health for the better one small step at a time!
