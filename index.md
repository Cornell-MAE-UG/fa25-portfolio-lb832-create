## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile_pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ Leslie }}, and I am a sophomore studying biomedical engineering at Cornell University. I am very interested in community engagement and education, and I love everything eye related. I work for an optometrist, and I shadowed an ophthalmologist over the summer. I hope to work on engineering eye products, such as contacts. I also love synthetic biology, and I worked on a project developing a salmonella detecting self-regenerating yeast solution. I want to change world health for the better one small step at a time!

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
